                ["Afghan president Ashraf Ghani on Friday said his country is experiencing an '1861 moment, like President Lincoln' after he met with President Joe Biden, while emphasizing that America’s decision to withdraw its troops was a sovereign one. Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, head of the country’s High Council for National Reconciliation, met with Biden in Washington, D.C., as the U.S. military largely withdrew from Afghanistan. Ghani said the leaders did not bring up the possibility of delaying the troop withdrawal when they met.'We respect that decision,' he said at the post-meeting news conference. 'Our course is to manage the consequences and to ensure that the people of Afghanistan rise to the challenge.' The meeting between the leaders comes amid concerns that the Afghan government could collapse within months of the U.S. withdrawal. The Afghan leader appeared resigned to the decision and spoke in both somber and positive tones. He brought up the U.S. embassy in Afghanistan, which will continue to operate, and America’s continued financial support for the country. He also said Biden will ensure that the Covid-19 vaccine makes its way to the Afghan people as the country continues to grapple with the pandemic in tandem with growing Taliban advances. Of the '1861 moment' Ghani described, he said Afghanistan is 'rallying to the defense of the republic, determined that the republic is defended. It's a choice of values, the values of an exclusionary system or an inclusionary system. We are determined to have unity, coherence, national sense of sacrifice and will not spare anything.' Biden told the Afghan leaders that though U.S. troops are leaving the country, America will still support Afghanistan through economic and political means, as well as helping the country maintain its military. The U.S. is expected to leave some 650 troops in the country. 'The senseless violence has to stop, but it’s going to be very difficult,' the president said. 'But we’re going to stick with you and we’re going to do our best to see to it you have the tools you need.' Biden told Ghani and Abdullah they are doing important work by 'trying to bring about unity among Afghan leaders' and said Afghans will have to decide what they want from their future. 'And they both got very difficult jobs,' Biden said of the leaders. 'Every time I think I’ve got a tough job, I think of Mr. President.' Throughout the day, Ghani’s message was one of perseverance as the Taliban advances in Afghanistan. He said the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces had retaken six districts that day. 'Let us understand that in great moments of transition, things happen,' Ghani said at the meeting with Biden. 'But you will see that with determination, with unity and with partnership, we will overcome all odds.'", "Representative Liberal"],
                ["Just before the start of Pride Month, Walmart, the largest retailer in the world, began selling a wide variety of rainbow-themed merchandise. A perusal of the company’s website reveals hundreds of such items for sale, like a Queer Eye-branded clothing line and tie-ins from rainbow-themed brands like Skittles and the Kellogg Company. You can even buy a shirt that reads: 'I can’t even think straight.' Walmart earned a perfect 100 percent rating on the Human Rights Campaign’s 2021 Corporate Equality Index, which scores companies based on their support of LGBTQ employees through HR policies, practices, and benefits, as well as their public advocacy. Earlier this year, when Arkansas — Walmart’s home state and the location of its global headquarters — banned both gender-affirming medical care for young people and the participation of trans girls and women in school sports, the CEO of the retail giant issued a statement calling the legislation 'troubling.' But in fact, Walmart had a direct hand in electing the very legislators who attacked trans kids. A recent Business Insider investigation found that since the beginning of 2018, Walmart had given $58,100 to the Arkansas state legislators who later sponsored the anti-trans bills. The investigation, which examined the campaign finance records of 76 Arkansas lawmakers, uncovered more than $400,000 in total donations to said lawmakers by the political action committees (PACs) behind nine corporations and industries that claim to be LGBTQ-inclusive. A Walmart spokesperson told BI that the political contributions were made before the bills’ introduction, adding that Walmart reviews its 'political giving strategy' on an ongoing basis. Now some families with trans kids in Arkansas are looking to flee the state just to avoid persecution. While Arkansas is so far the only state to fully ban transition care for everyone under the age of 18 (Tennessee passed a bill limiting transition care for prepubescent children, but transition care doesn’t normally happen until puberty), similar bills are still on the agenda in states whose legislative sessions haven’t ended yet. (Comparable proposals in 19 states failed, according to the Guardian.) On top of the push for medical bans, nine states have successfully banned trans girls from competing on girls’ sports teams this year. Trans advocates are worried the attacks will only accelerate. While companies like Walmart profit off of rainbow merchandise and branding, this recent wave of anti-trans legislation has largely been met with corporate silence. It’s not that corporations have historically stayed apolitical; in the recent past, many have shown up when it matters, influencing lawmakers on LGBTQ equality and having significant impact. Two years ago, when Bostock v. Clayton County was being heard by the Supreme Court, more than 200 companies — from Disney to Ernst & Young — cosigned an amicus brief calling for employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity to be made illegal. The Texas Chamber of Commerce was instrumental in keeping the conservative-controlled state legislature from instituting a bathroom bill. And in 2016, large corporations such as PayPal, alongside the NCAA and the NBA, were credited with the eventual rollback of North Carolina’s anti-LGBTQ bill, HB 2, after widespread backlash to the law cost the state around $3.7 billion over 12 years, per Associated Press estimates. 'We are really grateful to corporations that have stepped up to support LGBTQ folks in the past,' Viv Topping, director of advocacy and civic engagement at the Equality Federation, told Vox. 'But this year we saw a noticeable lack of engagement from corporations as the anti-trans bills have been further introduced across the country.' The corporate world, it seems, has been hesitant to weigh in on the debates over trans children. This is partially because conservatives have launched a misinformation campaign against trans kids and gender-affirming care that has left many reluctant to jump into the fray. It’s also because companies are often motivated into advocacy as a way to protect their employees — but parents of trans kids are rarer than gay employees. Corporations, their bottom lines, and retention rates have yet to be pushed into standing up for trans rights the same way they do for the larger LGBTQ community.", "Representative Liberal"],
                ["Last December, as then-President-elect Joe Biden was preparing to take office, a group of Latter-day Saint Democrats sent a letter to his transition team asking them to hire some of their own in his forthcoming administration.'We circulated a letter reminding the Biden transition team of, hey, Latter-day Saints have done a lot of work, we’re here, continue to cultivate us, put us in your administration,' said Rob Taber, co-chairman of Latter-day Saint Democrats and former national director for Latter-day Saints for Biden-Harris. The group never heard back from the Office of Presidential Personnel, and as far as they’re aware, the only Latter-day Saint appointment in the administration thus far has been Thomas Griffith, a recently retired federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals judge, and a George W. Bush nominee, whom Biden named to his Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States. 'Hopefully, we’ll see what happens after redistricting in Utah, that we can get a Democratic congressperson in Utah or maybe somewhere else moving forward, but it is a real issue of just cultivating the next generation of Latter-day Saint politicos,' Taber said. The number of young Latter-day Saint Democratic voters is on the rise. In 2007, nearly 70% of Latter-day Saints ages 18 to 29 identified as Republicans, the highest level of affiliation of any age group at the time, according to Pew, while in 2020, young Latter-day Saints were among those who voted for Biden in large numbers. The Cooperative Election Study found 47.5% of those ages 18 to 39 voted Biden-Harris. Despite the increase in Democratic support at the polls, the number of job opportunities and Latter-day Saint Democrats in elected office hasn’t kept pace. It’s a bottleneck that could have repercussions years down the road, though the struggle for these left-of-center church members hoping to break into politics isn’t new. Finding mentors and opportunities wasn’t easy for Steve Pierce, a senior director at the progressive public affairs agency Bully Pulpit Interactive. Pierce — who I first met in college — was a recent graduate looking for work in D.C. a decade ago. After sending out dozens of resumes without so much as an email rejection or call back, he attended a 'Beyond BYU' networking event at the Capitol that at first seemed to be a bust. 'I’m doing the networking thing and talking to all these people, meeting people, I’ve got my stack of homemade business cards made on my personal printer, and you know, it wasn’t super helpful because everybody I talked to was Republican, every single person,' he said. As the event was wrapping up, though, a Republican from his local congregation flagged a Democratic woman who was leaving. She had no connection to BYU. 'She just so happened, for whatever random reason, to be at that event at that particular time,' Pierce said. He sprinted up to her before she left to ask if she knew of any leads. The woman eventually connected him with his first job in Washington, working as an opposition researcher for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the U.S. House. 'That story is a uniquely Mormon Democratic story,' Pierce said. 'Because if you’re a Mormon Republican ... those networks and that infrastructure (exists) to help you break into the city and navigate this very strange place, and it works differently than everywhere else in America.' For Democrats, it’s much different. 'You have to rely on acts of God, in some ways, to make it,' he said. 'And that was hard. I got lucky.'", "Conservative"],
                ["A small group of lawmakers issued a statement declaring “an agreement on a framework” for police reform, meeting a self-imposed deadline to accomplish something before the Senate adjourned for two weeks. But the agreement announced Thursday by Rep. Karen Bass, a California Democrat; Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat; and Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, appears far from final or detailed enough to address whether the kind of comprehensive police reform many lawmakers want will ever pass Congress. “There is still more work to be done on the final bill, and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to,” the group said in a joint statement. “Over the next few weeks we look forward to continuing our work toward getting a finalized proposal across the finish line.” The two parties were negotiating a compromise that would protect individual officers from lawsuits but not police departments, which could be sued over individual officers' misconduct. Scott said last week the two parties were working on finalizing the qualified immunity language “to make sure we’re all saying the exact same thing.” Both parties have authored their own police reform measures in the wake of a string of police killings involving minorities. Republicans and Democrats generally agree on banning the use of chokeholds and “no-knock” warrants for drug offenses, as well as additional training and accountability measures, such as body-worn cameras and new reporting requirements for law enforcement. The negotiating team did not indicate how or if they have resolved qualified immunity. Republicans were critical of a proposal made by Booker that would maintain qualified immunity for officers but leave departments and municipalities open to lawsuits. It would add four new offenses that could lead to the prosecution of officers. The proposal drew criticism from some Republicans and law enforcement groups. “We are actively opposing the proposal and encouraging negotiators to reject this proposal as it is untenable,” the National Association of Police Organizations said in a statement earlier this month. As lawmakers negotiate a bill, the two parties are at odds over the future of policing. Some of the most liberal Democrats say police funding should be cut and diverted to mental health programs or other forms of public safety. Republicans point out that hundreds of police departments have experienced funding cuts in cities across America as crime rates rise in many places. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and the top GOP lawmaker on the Judiciary Committee, has been closely involved in the talks to produce a police reform bill and says the two parties are determined to reach a final deal.", "Conservative"],
