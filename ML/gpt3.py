            ["Afghan president Ashraf Ghani on Friday said his country is experiencing an '1861 moment, like President Lincoln' after he met with President Joe Biden, while emphasizing that America’s decision to withdraw its troops was a sovereign one. Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, head of the country’s High Council for National Reconciliation, met with Biden in Washington, D.C., as the U.S. military largely withdrew from Afghanistan. Ghani said the leaders did not bring up the possibility of delaying the troop withdrawal when they met.'We respect that decision,' he said at the post-meeting news conference. 'Our course is to manage the consequences and to ensure that the people of Afghanistan rise to the challenge.' The meeting between the leaders comes amid concerns that the Afghan government could collapse within months of the U.S. withdrawal. The Afghan leader appeared resigned to the decision and spoke in both somber and positive tones. He brought up the U.S. embassy in Afghanistan, which will continue to operate, and America’s continued financial support for the country. He also said Biden will ensure that the Covid-19 vaccine makes its way to the Afghan people as the country continues to grapple with the pandemic in tandem with growing Taliban advances. Of the '1861 moment' Ghani described, he said Afghanistan is 'rallying to the defense of the republic, determined that the republic is defended. It's a choice of values, the values of an exclusionary system or an inclusionary system. We are determined to have unity, coherence, national sense of sacrifice and will not spare anything.' Biden told the Afghan leaders that though U.S. troops are leaving the country, America will still support Afghanistan through economic and political means, as well as helping the country maintain its military. The U.S. is expected to leave some 650 troops in the country. 'The senseless violence has to stop, but it’s going to be very difficult,' the president said.  ", "representative liberal"],
            ["Just before the start of Pride Month, Walmart, the largest retailer in the world, began selling a wide variety of rainbow-themed merchandise. A perusal of the company’s website reveals hundreds of such items for sale, like a Queer Eye-branded clothing line and tie-ins from rainbow-themed brands like Skittles and the Kellogg Company. You can even buy a shirt that reads: 'I can’t even think straight.' Walmart earned a perfect 100 percent rating on the Human Rights Campaign’s 2021 Corporate Equality Index, which scores companies based on their support of LGBTQ employees through HR policies, practices, and benefits, as well as their public advocacy. Earlier this year, when Arkansas — Walmart’s home state and the location of its global headquarters — banned both gender-affirming medical care for young people and the participation of trans girls and women in school sports, the CEO of the retail giant issued a statement calling the legislation 'troubling.' But in fact, Walmart had a direct hand in electing the very legislators who attacked trans kids. A recent Business Insider investigation found that since the beginning of 2018, Walmart had given $58,100 to the Arkansas state legislators who later sponsored the anti-trans bills. The investigation, which examined the campaign finance records of 76 Arkansas lawmakers, uncovered more than $400,000 in total donations to said lawmakers by the political action committees (PACs) behind nine corporations and industries that claim to be LGBTQ-inclusive. A Walmart spokesperson told BI that the political contributions were made before the bills’ introduction, adding that Walmart reviews its 'political giving strategy' on an ongoing basis. Now some families with trans kids in Arkansas are looking to flee the state just to avoid persecution. While Arkansas is so far the only state to fully ban transition care for everyone under the age of 18 (Tennessee passed a bill limiting transition care for prepubescent children, but transition care doesn’t normally happen until puberty)", "representative liberal"],        
            ["The Biden administration is investigating conditions faced by hundreds of migrant children held by the U.S. government at a military installation in Texas, White House officials said Friday. Symone Sanders, a spokesperson for the vice president, told reporters that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris instructed Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra to conduct a 'thorough investigation' into conditions at the tent camp inside the Fort Bliss U.S. Army base holding unaccompanied migrant minors. CBS News reported this week that migrant children housed at Fort Bliss — one of several emergency housing sites set up by HHS this spring — have been constantly monitored for self-harm, escape attempts and panic attacks.  'The administration is taking this very seriously,' Sanders said on board Air Force Two, which took Harris and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to El Paso Friday. A White House official said later on Friday that Mr. Biden did not order a formal investigation. 'While the care of children is deeply important to this administration – HHS has already been looking into Fort Bliss and numerous aspects have significantly been improved,' the official said. Some distressed teenagers at the base have been placed on one-on-one supervision 24 hours a day to make sure they don't harm themselves. Officials at the tent camp also prohibited the use of pencils, nail clippers, regular toothbrushes and metal items out of fear that children could use them to hurt themselves. According to federal volunteers who worked at Fort Bliss, lawyers who visited the site and testimonies from minors held there, the source of the distress and frustration among children stems largely from living conditions and prolonged stays at the tent camp, which is located in the Chihuahuan Desert. Representatives for HHS did not respond to a request to comment on the White House's announcement.  HHS has said more mental health specialists and case managers have been assigned to help children housed" , "representative liberal"],
            ["Gianna Floyd just wants to play with her dad. That’s what she said in her victim impact statement via video during the sentencing of Derek Chauvin for the murder of Gianna’s father, George Floyd. Chauvin was sentenced by Judge Peter Cahill to twenty-two-and-one-half years in prison. He also can never own firearms again, and he must register as a predatory offender upon release. After seven-year-old Gianna Floyd made her statement, George Floyd’s nephew, Brandon Williams, and two brothers, Terrence and Philonise Floyd, shared their own statements and asked that Chauvin be given the maximum sentence of forty years without parole. True justice would be abolishing the system that allowed George Floyd to be murdered in the first place.“My family and I have been given a life sentence,” Philonise Floyd said. “We will never be able to get George back.” On behalf of the prosecution team, Assistant Minnesota Attorney General Matthew Frank addressed the impact that Chauvin’s murder of George Floyd has had on the community, specifically the Floyd family. During his statement, he referred to Chauvin’s treatment of George Floyd as “torture,” recalling the nine-and-a-half minutes that Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck, and asked that Cahill sentence Chauvin to thirty years. For the first time since the trial began, Derek Chauvin spoke. “At this time, due to some additional legal matters at hand, I’m not able to give a full statement, but very briefly I want to send my condolences to the Floyd family,” he said. Chauvin, however, did not apologize to the Floyd family for murdering their loved one. Instead, he said, “There’s going to be some other information in the future that would be of interest, and I hope things will give you some peace of mind.” Chauvin’s mother, Carolyn Pawlenty, also made a statement in which she described Chauvin as “honorable” and insisted that she will maintain his innocence regardless of his sentence. There have been ongoing protests and actions in the Twin Cities since George Floyd was murdered", "representative liberal"],
            ["American billionaires don’t pay taxes, and American politicians are all but ready to send Seal Team Six to assassinate the nameless bureaucrat who let ProPublica in on this fact. Welcome to our political hellscape. This month, ProPublica revealed that American billionaires essentially do not pay taxes, and within hours the White House had awkwardly promised no fewer than four federal investigations into the identity of the individual who had alerted the news organization to this fact. By Thursday, a North Carolina congressman was demanding the FBI director explain why he hadn’t made any arrests or at the very least, “executed any search warrants or raided any offices” in the international manhunt for the leaker. By the weekend, demands for justice on behalf of America’s parasite oligarchs had unified the Republican party like nothing since perhaps the phrase “public option” was a thing you heard on cable television. Politicians from Susan Collins to the author of the infamous North Carolina “bathroom bill” both grilled law enforcement officials testifying in their committees about the website’s “illegal” violations of mega-billionaire privacy. Fox News screamed about Twitter’s double standard in enabling sharing of the ProPublica revelations despite blocking an earlier New York Post story about Hunter Biden’s laptop. At least 19 senators signed angry letters demanding the investigations they had been repeatedly assured were well under way. (Senator Mike Crapo alone released three separate statements to this effect.) The ranking member of the powerful ways and means committee told the Hill on Friday that the revelations had dealt Democratic proposals to add an additional $8bn to the annual IRS budget – which was meant to help with tax law enforcement and compliance – “close to a death blow”. Meanwhile, the Democrats hardly had a better response. The billionaire tax avoidance story warranted nary a mention on the Twitter feeds of the four founders of “the Squad” aside from a retweet from AOC.", "representative liberal"],
            ["A small group of lawmakers issued a statement declaring 'an agreement on a framework' for police reform, meeting a self-imposed deadline to accomplish something before the Senate adjourned for two weeks. But the agreement announced Thursday by Rep. Karen Bass, a California Democrat; Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat; and Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, appears far from final or detailed enough to address whether the kind of comprehensive police reform many lawmakers want will ever pass Congress. 'There is still more work to be done on the final bill, and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to,' the group said in a joint statement. 'Over the next few weeks we look forward to continuing our work toward getting a finalized proposal across the finish line.' The two parties were negotiating a compromise that would protect individual officers from lawsuits but not police departments, which could be sued over individual officers' misconduct. Scott said last week the two parties were working on finalizing the qualified immunity language 'to make sure we’re all saying the exact same thing.' Both parties have authored their own police reform measures in the wake of a string of police killings involving minorities. Republicans and Democrats generally agree on banning the use of chokeholds and 'no-knock' warrants for drug offenses, as well as additional training and accountability measures, such as body-worn cameras and new reporting requirements for law enforcement. The negotiating team did not indicate how or if they have resolved qualified immunity. Republicans were critical of a proposal made by Booker that would maintain qualified immunity for officers but leave departments and municipalities open to lawsuits. It would add four new offenses that could lead to the prosecution of officers. The proposal drew criticism from some Republicans and law enforcement groups. 'We are actively opposing the proposal and encouraging negotiators to reject this proposal as it is untenable,'", "conservative"],
            ["The EPA has wide latitude to exempt refineries from federal mandates that they mix renewable fuels into gasoline and diesel, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Friday, a victory for oil companies seeking a break from the requirements. In a 6-3 decision, the justices rejected arguments that the Environmental Protection Agency’s exemption power is limited to only a handful of refineries that have received uninterrupted annual waivers from the Renewable Fuel Standard. Writing for the majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch said that nothing in the Renewable Fuel Standard law itself 'commands a continuity requirement.' Under President Joe Biden, the EPA is expected to issue fewer waivers and force more refineries to satisfy annual biofuel quotas by either blending plant-based alternatives into their products or buying compliance credits from other companies that have. However, the Supreme Court precedent will give future administrations wide clearance to exempt oil refineries from annual blending quotas. It also provides the Biden administration with more options for addressing concerns by some lawmakers and industry officials that climbing compliance costs imperil some independent refiners, particularly in the Northeast U.S. Several governors and non-integrated refineries, including PBF Energy Inc., and Delta Air Lines Inc.’s Monroe Energy LLC, have urged EPA to lower quotas. Several refiners rose on the ruling, while biofuel makers sank. The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration and Production Select Industry Index was up 1.6% after rising as much as 1.8%. Among the top movers on the index was PBF Energy Inc., which jumped as much as 9.9% and was up 2.2% to $16.49 at 11:08 a.m. in New York trading. HollyFrontier Corp. climbed as much as 3.4% and was up 1.3% to $34.11. CVR Energy Inc. rose as much as 5.4% and was up 4% to $19.81. Biofuel maker Darling Ingredients Inc. dropped as much as 9.9% before recovering some of its losses. It was down 3.1% to $63.15, while Renewable Energy Group Inc. was down 6.7% to $60.03 after dropping as much as 7.7%. ", "conservative"],
            ["A year ago, a majority of the Minneapolis City Council pledged to disband the police department. At protests around the country, left-wing activists chanted, 'Defund the police!' And in New York City, an insurgent representative liberal who embraced that slogan ousted a longtime Democratic congressman. But now, President Biden is inviting local governments to use federal money to fund police departments and hire more officers. The Democratic mayor of Minneapolis wants to replenish his city’s police force. And a former policeman running on a law-and-order platform is leading as votes are counted in the Democratic primary for New York mayor. Thirteen months after the police killing of George Floyd sparked an impassioned movement in the Democratic Party to rein in police departments, a surge in homicides has prompted a shift in the opposite direction. Democrats are scrambling to make new investments in policing and seeking to project toughness on crime, even as they continue pushing for police reforms and alternative means of deterring crime. Now in control of the White House, Congress and most big cities, Democrats have struggled to contain the deadly violence this year, which is expected to worsen as the summer progresses. They are facing a barrage of criticism from Republicans, who are portraying Democrats as soft on crime as part of a coordinated strategy for next year’s midterm elections. These trends have alarmed Democrats at all levels — from the White House, where Biden recently delivered his first major speech on fighting crime; to voters, who are rallying behind crime-focused candidates in early primaries; to U.S. House members who are bluntly warning representative liberal colleagues to tone down their attacks on law enforcement. ' ‘Defund police’ is a phrase that I wish had never been uttered,' said Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), who ran the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee when Republicans picked up 13 House seats over the two-year 2020 election cycle.

That’s what a some Senate Republicans are asking the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to do by urging the agency to lift mask mandates for Americans on public transportation. The Senators, led by Texas’ Ted Cruz, introduced a resolution Friday which called on the agency to lift its mask mandate on vaccinated Americans who travel on planes, trains and other forms of mass transit, The Hill reported. 'It’s long past time for President Biden and the CDC to follow the science and end this mask mandate for fully vaccinated individuals,' Cruz said in a statement announcing the resolution. 'Americans should be able to travel to celebrate Independence Day with their friends and loved ones without having to follow an outdated and unnecessary mandate.' Masks are required on subway stations in New York City. Cruz was joined by Maine’s Susan Collins, Tennessee’s Marsha Blackburn, Kansas’ Jerry Moran, Mississippi’s Roger Wicker and Wyoming’s Cynthia Lummis. 'It makes no sense that someone can go to a restaurant without wearing a mask, but they cannot fly on an airplane without one even though it has a far better ventilation system,' Collins added saying that flight attendants told her they were afraid that continuing to enforce the mask mandate could lead to violence on flights. Sen. Ted Cruz argues mask mandates are 'outdated and unnecessary.' On his first day in office, President Biden signed an executive order mandating mask wearing on all public transportation.

            ["Former President Donald Trump mocked the nation’s 'woke generals' and bashed their embrace of critical race theory during his first post-White House rally Saturday in tiny Wellington, Ohio. 'The Biden administration issued new rules pushing twisted critical race theory … into our military,' Trump told several thousand supporters gathered at the Lorain County Fairgrounds. 'Our generals and our admirals are now focused more on this nonsense than they are on our enemies.' 'You see these generals lately on television? They are woke,' he said. 'Our military will be incapable of fighting and incapable of taking orders,' Trump predicted — imagining a future private refusing to comply with a general’s order. 'That private’s going to tell the general, ‘Don’t you ever speak to me that way, general — I’ll kick your ass,’' Trump said. 'That’s our military, that’s where we’re going. Woke.' Former President Donald Trump slammed President Joe Biden in his first post-presidency rally in Ohio on June 26, 2021. Trump also went after 'woke generals' and the recent debate about critical race theory. On Wednesday, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Pentagon’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, defended critical race theory — the idea that racism pervades all of American society — and its use in the West Point curriculum before the House Armed Services Committee. 'The military brass have become weak and ineffective leaders,' Trump charged. 'And our enemies are watching and they’re laughing.' Trump used the rally to boost the campaign of former White House aide Max Miller, who plans to primary Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. Trump slammed President Biden repeatedly during the 90-minute speech — between lengthy asides on the allegedly stolen 2020 presidential election.

In a letter to Commissioner Charles Rettig, Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy and 14 other congressional Republicans called the decision 'blatantly biased, discriminatory, and flawed,' and requested the IRS head personally review the case. Stephen Martin, IRS director of exempt organizations, said in a May letter to Christians Engaged, that the group did not qualify for the federal tax exemption status because it 'engaged in prohibited political campaign intervention.'  'While you educate voters on what the bible says about issues, your educational activities are not neutral,' Martin wrote to the group. 'The topics typically are affiliated with distinct candidates and specific political party platforms.' The IRS director pointed to the group’s work in teaching followers about 'the sanctity of life, the definition of marriage, biblical justice, laws vs. lawlessness, freedom of speech, religious liberty, government and business ethics, human trafficking, fiscal responsibility in government budgeting, defense, borders and immigration, U.S. and Israel relations.' But Republicans on the Hill argued these topics did align with Christian dogma. 'These issues have always been at the core of Christian belief and classifying them as inherently political is patently absurd,' the group of lawmakers wrote in the Friday letter. 'If the IRS applied this interpretation broadly, it would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of thousands of Christian churches across the country.'

'We’re going to elect an amazing slate of America First Republicans next year,' Trump said. The former president’s rally speech had a level of renewed urgency, as he outlined a long list of Biden’s failures in office. 'The number one priority for everyone who wants to save America is to put every ounce of energy into winning a victory in midterms and in 2024,' he said. Trump campaigned for Max Miller, a primary challenger to Republican Rep. Anthony Gonzales (R-OH), who voted to impeach Trump. 'Every single Republican needs to vote him out of office,' Trump said, calling Gonzales a 'grandstanding RINO.' 'He’s not the candidate you want representing the Republican party. He’s the candidate of Liz Cheney, another beauty,' he added. After criticizing at length the policies of Biden and Congressional Democrats, Trump called for a massive political reset in the 2022 midterms. 'You have to deliver massive majorities for Republicans in Congress next year, have to do it,' he said. The former president thrilled supporters with some of his greatest hits — including a dramatic reading of the poem 'The Snake' to describe the threat of illegal immigration. 'In the Republican party we do not believe that we should welcome criminals with open arms,' he said. Trump said that Democrats had used the coronavirus pandemic to 'steal the election' and called for his supporters to rally in the midterms. 'With the help of everyone here tonight and patriots across the country, we will do all that we are supposed to be doing and much more when we win giant republican majorities next year,' he promised.

This is now the message coming from the media: The narrative about how society should look at this incident shall remain in accordance with the most radical, 'woke' voices. Deviating opinions will not be tolerated. Words are violence. That attitude was on full display in a dustup at America’s leading representative liberal newspaper. Chaos at The New York Times began after it published an editorial by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who argued that cities with police forces overwhelmed by looting and violence have the option, under the federal Insurrection Act, to request aid from the military. The article’s headline was 'Call in the Troops,' which had been selected by New York Times editors. In it, Cotton explained how military force has been used to quell domestic unrest in the past, including those who attempted to obstruct desegregation at Little Rock’s Central High School in Arkansas in 1957. Following the article’s publication on June 3, New York Times reporters and editors protested publicly en masse. Many claimed that Cotton’s opinions put their colleagues 'in danger.'

On the Democratic front, although the progressive Sanders-Warren-AOC wing of the party continues to push for representative liberal reforms, we’ve seen 'more of the same' establishment-friendly politics from the neorepresentative liberal Biden wing that’s dominated the party for decades. This will come as no shock to those of us who have lamented the plutocratic biases of the Democrats during the Obama years and before. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the Biden wing of the party has disappointed representative liberals. They campaigned on politically empowering the poor and people of color, on implementing a $15 minimum wage, on expanding access to health care through a public option, on providing relief on the student loan front, and combating the steadily intensifying climate crisis. Thus far, there has been little by way of delivery. The 'For the People Act,' which is meant to combat Republican efforts to suppress voting among the poor and poor people of color, has passed the House by 220-210 votes, but remains stalled in the Senate by a few conservative Democratic holdouts – Senators Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema. The party hasn’t acted on passing a $15 minimum wage due to resistance from these senators and a few others who have also blocked action.

Two of the bills established new restrictions on voting, including a provision that could make it a crime to collect and submit ballots on behalf of another voter. The third bill made it illegal to protest near oil and gas pipelines, with a potential punishment of up to 18 months in prison and thousands of dollars in fines. The new laws appear to have a clear target: the members of Montana’s various Native American tribes, who rely heavily on mass ballot collection drives in order to vote, and who in recent years have led protests against major oil and gas pipeline projects that posed a threat to their lands. The GOP has sought for years to limit the right to protest and curb access to the vote. But both efforts have intensified across the country in 2021. So far this year, eight states, including Montana, have passed laws that create new criminal penalties related to protesting, according to the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, which tracks such legislation. At the same time, Republicans have enacted new laws that create or strengthen criminal penalties related to voting or election practices in at least half a dozen states. Many of these laws, like Montana’s, have explicitly criminalized or strengthened criminal penalties on the practice of returning ballots on behalf of voters. And as is the apparent case in Montana, the wave of anti-voting and anti-protest laws ― a wave that civil rights groups say is unprecedented since the civil rights movement of the 1960s ― is not just broadly anti-democratic. It is also a specific assault on the rights of Black, brown and Native Americans. 'They are responding to people who are trying to use fundamental rights in American society, whether it’s the right to vote or the right to protest, not by enabling people to tell legislators what they want and what they care about, but by seeking to cast them as criminals and silence them, both at the ballot and on the streets,' said Vera Eidelman, a ", "sjw"],
            ["This week, in a near-unanimous vote, the U.S. Senate passed an amendment to help heirs’ property owners clear titles. Heirs’ property refers to land that has been handed down informally within families, often over several generations; without clear title, the land is vulnerable to legal loopholes that jeopardize ownership. The amendment included $5 million for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s relending program, which would assist families with heirs’ property in resolving ownership issues. The funding is the same amount included in a House bill, which passed in June. The program allows eligible lending organizations, like cooperatives and credit unions, to provide loans to landowners who are seeking to clear up or consolidate ownership, helping them pay for legal assistance or obtain necessary documentation, for example. In a statement sent to the Democratic caucus ahead of the Monday vote, Sen. Doug Jones, a Democrat from Alabama who introduced the amendment, cited a ProPublica-New Yorker story about heirs’ property and its disproportionate impact on African American families, many of whom have lost land. The article featured a pair of brothers who spent eight years in jail for refusing to leave waterfront land that had been sold to developers, though their family had held the property for a century. “These injustices have had long-lasting consequences for the families who have struggled to prove their claims, including the untold emotional cost for those who have seen their family land taken or sold out from under them,” Jones said in a speech Monday night on the Senate floor, before the amendment passed 91-1. Heirs’ property owners cannot qualify for some USDA loans for farming, and they often can’t receive disaster relief funding or use their land as collateral for private lending.

It was a threat … They weren’t protesting anything specific that I had said. They weren’t asking me to change anything. They weren’t protesting a policy or advocating for legislation … They were threatening me and my family and telling me to leave my own neighborhood in the city that I grew up in.” Even more alarming, according to the Post, “A woman was also overheard in one of the deleted videos saying she wanted to ‘bring a pipe bomb’ to his house, [Carlson] said.” Other prestige media sources echoed the Post’s story. NBC headlined its article: “Antifa Group Chants Outside, Vandalizes Fox Commentator Tucker Carlson’s Home.” The CNN communications team, NPR’s Scott Simon, and the CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert all condemned the reported home invasion. “Fighting Tucker Carlson’s ideas is an American right. Targeting his home and terrorizing his family is an act of monstrous cowardice. Obviously don’t do this, but also, take no pleasure in it happening. Feeding monsters just makes more monsters,” Colbert wrote on Twitter. Over the next week, further reporting cast significant doubt on Carlson’s version of events. The police report mentioned nothing about a cracked front door—and photographs showed the door entirely undamaged. The police report did not mention a pipe bomb, either.

In remarks to the media earlier this week, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said the state has confirmed more than 1.3 million fraudulent unemployment claims since the beginning of the pandemic and is investigating 508,000 potentially fraudulent claims filed since the beginning of May. While Maryland's figures are eye-popping, it is likely not the only state being targeted by benefit thieves. California, Ohio, and others have been swamped by fake unemployment claims at various times during the pandemic—one particularly gutsy scammer filed a claim using Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly's name. In Washington state, one man was arrested after allegedly using more than 100 different identities to claim over $350,000 in unemployment benefits. One estimate from a private firm that combats identity theft suggests that as much as $400 billion in unemployment payments made during the pandemic—nearly half of the national total—may have been stolen. Thieves are probably targeting the unemployment system because that's where the money is. 'Criminals and scammers—including sophisticated, international crime rings—have been attracted by the enhanced weekly payments authorized by Congress,' reports CNN. 'Prior to the pandemic, unemployment benefits were typically not that generous and, therefore, not as much of a target.'

            ["The US justice department has said it will sue Georgia over its new law limiting ballot access, in the Biden administration’s first big legal action against voting restrictions in Republican-led states. Merrick Garland, the attorney-general, announced the move on Friday and signalled it could be a precursor to action against other states that have adopted or were considering similar measures to limit voting. “Our complaint alleges that recent changes to Georgia’s election laws were enacted with the purpose of denying or abridging the right of black Georgians to vote on account of their race or colour,” Garland said. The battle over voting right is shaping up to become one of the most contentious political fights of the post-Trump era, with Democrats and Republicans engaged in fierce state-level fights aimed at shaping the landscape for the 2022 midterm elections. Democrats have accused Republicans of using new voting restraints to disenfranchise black and other traditionally Democratic voters, while Republicans have countered that loose eligibility rules have allowed rampant fraud — an unsubstantiated allegation often repeated by former President Donald Trump.

            ["WASHINGTON — It was all going according to President Biden’s tightrope plan to pass the most ambitious economic agenda in generations. Right until the moment that Mr. Biden, a politician with a history of rogue comments, veered off script. After weeks of closed-door negotiations, Mr. Biden strode to the cameras on the White House driveway on Thursday, flanked by an equal number of Democratic and Republican lawmakers, to proudly announce an overall infrastructure agreement totaling $1.2 trillion over eight years that could cement his legacy as a bipartisan deal maker. Mr. Biden and his top aides had successfully struck a limited agreement with key centrist senators to rebuild roads and bridges while carefully signaling to liberals that he still intended to embrace a measure — likely to gain only Democratic support — to spend trillions more on climate, education, child care and other economic priorities. It was an 'I told you so' moment for a president who is supremely confident in his ability to navigate legislative negotiations. But in a stray comment during a news conference an hour later, the president blurted out that he would not approve the compromise bill without the partisan one. 'If this is the only thing that comes to me, I’m not signing it,' he said, answering a question about the timing of his legislative agenda. 'I’m not just signing the bipartisan bill and forgetting about the rest.' It may not seem like much, but it was enough to upend Mr. Biden’s proud bipartisan moment. On the one hand, he was saying out loud what liberals in his party wanted to hear. But to the centrist senators and Republicans, it made explicit a notion that had only been hinted at before — that Mr. Biden not only intended to sign a second, more ambitious package, but that he would also go so far as to veto their bipartisan plan if the larger bill did not materialize. 'We never had an inkling that there would be any kind of linkage,' Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and a key negotiator, said in an interview. 'We always knew that there’d be another bill, but not that the success of the infrastructure package was going to be in any way dependent on the other bill.' Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, was among the key negotiators of the deal. She said in an interview that centrist senators and Republicans 'never had an inkling that there would be any kind of linkage.' For more than 24 hours, the White House engaged in damage control, with top advisers calling senators from both parties. On Friday, the president’s spokeswoman gently tried to distance the administration from his comments. It was not enough. And on Saturday, as lawmakers and aides continued to stew and the prospects of a legislative victory seemed to fade, Mr. Biden conceded that he had misspoken. The drama does not appear to have sunk the deal, but Mr. Biden admitted that his comments on Thursday left 'the impression that I was issuing a veto threat on the very plan I had just agreed to.' That was 'certainly not my intent,' he added. The agreement Mr. Biden heralded on Thursday initially looked like an unfettered triumph for a president who promised voters he could deliver legislation that was both boldly progressive and widely bipartisan. It was weeks in the making. By late May, Senators Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and Kyrsten Sinema, Democrat of Arizona, had cobbled together eight other centrist colleagues to discuss the possibilities of a bipartisan framework that could replicate the success that led to the passage of a $900 billion coronavirus relief bill in December.
